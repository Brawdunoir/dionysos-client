## Project setup

### 1. Install NodeJS
The best way to get NodeJS is with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nvm for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).  
The NodeJS version used for the project is the `16.15.1`  

### 2. Install pnpm
Pnpm is used as the packet manager for itâ€™s speed and space efficiency while remaining compatible with Tauri.  
`npm install -g pnpm`  

### 3. Install Tauri dependencies
You need to install Rust and some other dependencies.  
You can check os dependent installation [here](https://tauri.studio/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites/).
